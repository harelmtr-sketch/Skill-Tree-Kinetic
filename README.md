Hello, my name is peter parker... monday broke me


## Manual edge wiring workflow
1. Open `index.html` in Live Server.
2. Click **Load Existing Tree** (it also auto-loads on start) to keep your current node count/positions from `skill_tree_graph.json`.
3. Click **Clear Edges Only** if you want to reconnect from scratch.
4. In **Edge Mode**, click node A then node B to add each connection manually.
5. Click **Download skill_tree_graph.json** and replace the repo file with that downloaded file to permanently store your manual graph.
